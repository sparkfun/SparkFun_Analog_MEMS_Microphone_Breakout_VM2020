[*SparkFun Analog MEMS Microphone Breakout VM2020 [BOB-21537]*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/21537)

The SparkFun Analog MEMS Microphone Breakout makes it easy to work with the VM2020 analog microphone from Vesper.

The VM2020 is an ultra-high AOP, high dynamic range, differential analog output piezoelectric MEMS microphone.
This microphone consists of a piezoelectric sensor and circuitry to buffer and amplify the output.
It has an acoustic overload point of 152dB SPL for audio capture in loud environments. 
The VM2020 has a small 3.76 mm X 2.95 mm X 1.3 mm package. 
This microphone is reflow solder compatible with no sensitivity degradation.

Also note, this low profile microphone has its port on the bottom side, so the microphone can be mounted flush to the outer surface of your enclosure. This microphone is omni-directional, which means it does a good job of picking up sound sources from all directions.
